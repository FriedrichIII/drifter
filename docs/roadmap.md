The future ?
============

The framework will evolve as we use it on more projects. It is not the goal to refrain you
from doing anything. It will be improved as we need it, the goal is to serve the team !

What could be done if the need arise :

* Better installer with questions to automatically create the config files instead of manual editing
* Improve the `Vagrantfile` extension mechanism
* Provide a role to simply the creation of a Symfony project

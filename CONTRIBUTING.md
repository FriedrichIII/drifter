### Suggesting Enhancements

* Check the https://github.com/liip/drifter/tree/master/provisioning/roles directory, not all roles are listing in `playbook.yml`
* Does the feature will be useful for multiple people or just your project ?
* Check the existing issues / PR to see if something similar is already being proposed.

### Pull Requests

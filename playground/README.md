Playground
----------

This directory is here to ease the testing of the framework
during development.

You can change the config files and quickly try new roles or
modifications without having to resort to an "outside" installation.

Ignoring changes with git
=========================

To further ease the process, git allows you to ignore change made
to certain files, so any change you make in here wont even show
when you run `git status`.

    git update-index --assume-unchanged virtualization/*

RawBot Docker
=============

This repository is a template to ease creating development environment for the RawBot team @ Liip Lausanne.

It contains :

* A script to build a base Docker image based on a Debian environment
* A Dockerfile template to create a Docker image for a project
* Ansible playbooks templates to provision the image based on the needs (PHP, Django, etc)
* A Vagrant box to run the docker images on OS X and Windows (see https://github.com/liip/dockerbox)

Overview
========

In order to streamline our project setups and to ease the "entry cost" for a new squad member, we
decided as a team to use a common virtualized development environment.

Docker image
============

Instead of using images not known to be safe from the Docker Registry ( https://registry.hub.docker.com/ ),
we try as much as possible to use images build by us. There is multiple reasons to do so :

* We use provisioning anyway
* Guarantee to know what is in the image
* Tailor-made base image to our need


Dockerfile
==========

The Dockerfile is an example that can most of the time be copied as is to the project root directory.

Its goal is to build a tailor made image for the project using Ansible provisioning to install all
necessary software packages and do required configuration.

Ansible
=======

Various roles are provided in the `ansible/roles` directory. Each of those roles should be autonomous,
but you probably will have to use multiple of them to have a coherent system. For example :

* base
* nginx
* php-fpm
* mysql

If you want a PHP website served with an nginx server. An exemple on how to do that is given in the playbook.yml file.

Vagrant
=======
